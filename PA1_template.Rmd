# Loading and Preprocessing the Data

```{r setup, echo=TRUE}
# Load necessary packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load the data
activity_data <- read.csv("activity.csv")

# View the structure of the dataset
str(activity_data)
```
## Mean Total Number of Steps Taken per Day
```{r}
# Calculate total number of steps taken per day
total_steps_per_day <- activity_data %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarize(total_steps = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot histogram of total number of steps taken each day
ggplot(total_steps_per_day, aes(x = total_steps)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day", x = "Total Steps", y = "Frequency")
```

```{r}
# Calculate mean and median total number of steps taken per day
mean_steps <- mean(total_steps_per_day$total_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median_steps <- median(total_steps_per_day$total_steps, na.rm = TRUE)

mean_steps
median_steps
```
## Average Daily Activity Pattern
```{r}
# Calculate average number of steps taken in each 5-minute interval
average_steps_interval <- activity_data %>% 
  group_by(interval) %>% 
  summarize(average_steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot time series of 5-minute interval and average number of steps taken
ggplot(average_steps_interval, aes(x = interval, y = average_steps)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Average Daily Activity Pattern", x = "5-minute Interval", y = "Average Number of Steps")
```

```{r}
# Find the 5-minute interval that contains the maximum number of steps on average
max_interval <- average_steps_interval[which.max(average_steps_interval$average_steps), ]
max_interval
```
## Imputing Missing Values
```{r}
# Calculate total number of missing values
total_na <- sum(is.na(activity_data$steps))

total_na

# Fill in missing values with the mean for that 5-minute interval
activity_data_imputed <- activity_data
activity_data_imputed$steps[is.na(activity_data_imputed$steps)] <- average_steps_interval$average_steps[match(activity_data_imputed$interval[is.na(activity_data_imputed$steps)], average_steps_interval$interval)]

# Verify that there are no more missing values
sum(is.na(activity_data_imputed$steps))
```
```{r}
# Calculate total number of steps taken per day with imputed data
total_steps_per_day_imputed <- activity_data_imputed %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarize(total_steps = sum(steps))

# Plot histogram of total number of steps taken each day with imputed data
ggplot(total_steps_per_day_imputed, aes(x = total_steps)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000, fill = "green", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day (Imputed Data)", x = "Total Steps", y = "Frequency")

# Calculate and report mean and median total number of steps taken per day with imputed data
mean_steps_imputed <- mean(total_steps_per_day_imputed$total_steps)
median_steps_imputed <- median(total_steps_per_day_imputed$total_steps)

mean_steps_imputed
median_steps_imputed
```
## Differences in Activity Patterns Between Weekdays and Weekends
```{r}
# Create a new factor variable for weekday/weekend
activity_data_imputed$date <- as.Date(activity_data_imputed$date)
activity_data_imputed$day_type <- ifelse(weekdays(activity_data_imputed$date) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", "weekday")

# Calculate average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
average_steps_day_type <- activity_data_imputed %>% 
  group_by(interval, day_type) %>% 
  summarize(average_steps = mean(steps))

# Plot panel plot comparing average number of steps per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
ggplot(average_steps_day_type, aes(x = interval, y = average_steps, color = day_type)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~day_type, ncol = 1) +
  labs(title = "Average Daily Activity Pattern: Weekday vs. Weekend", x = "5-minute Interval", y = "Average Number of Steps")
```
